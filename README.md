# Quick Description

## The formation configuration is described in [Alexandre S Brandao et al. “A multi-layer control scheme for a centralized uav formation”. In:
2014 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS). IEEE. 2014,
pp. 1181–1187.]

## The formation configuration has two levels: 
			  * Control the formation shape (stabilizing the relative distances between agents).
        * Trajectory tracking control for each robot (following the predefined path).
        
### In the simulation below we considered a Hover like system  --->  Applying a Proportional and derivative controller [Wudao Ling Xuanyu Zhou Yiren Lu Myles Cai.
